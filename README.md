# 💼 Major Research Project – Money Laundering Detection using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This project is part of my Master's in Data Science and Analytics. It focuses on identifying money laundering activities in transactional datasets using a combination of traditional machine learning, anomaly detection, and deep learning techniques.

## 🔍 Objective

To build a predictive system capable of detecting suspicious transactions that indicate potential money laundering. The goal is to explore multiple approaches, handle class imbalance, and evaluate performance across models to identify the most effective fraud detection strategy.
